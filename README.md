chronosphere
===========

Simple cron format parser - a quick experiment created to see how would be the
best way to implement something like this and to play around with a few
optimization strategies. Mostly done because I was interested in seeing if I
could optimize something I had seen done.

Croniter might be a more effective PyPI package.
